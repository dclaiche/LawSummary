  "text": "It was a warm summer Sunday morning on August 24, 1924 when Helen Palsgraf stood on the platform of the East New York station of the Long Island Railroad, waiting to catch a train to take her two daughters to the beach at Rockaway. As her train stood in the station, another train arrived and began pulling out. Two men sprinted across the platform to catch the departing train. The first man leaped aboard without incident. The second man, carrying a small brown paper package under his arm, stumbled as he tried to board. A guard on the train reached down to pull him aboard, while a guard on the platform pushed him from behind. In the commotion, the package was dislodged from the man's arm and fell onto the tracks. The package, which was about fifteen inches long and wrapped in newspaper, contained fireworks. When it hit the rails, the fireworks exploded. The shock of the explosion caused a large penny scale, located at the other end of the platform many feet away from the blast, to topple over and strike Helen Palsgraf, injuring her arm, causing a severe stammer, and other injuries. Helen Palsgraf sued the Long Island Railroad Company for damages caused by the alleged negligence of its employees in helping the man board the train. She argued that the guards' clumsy assistance to the passenger was negligent and that this negligence was the proximate cause of her injuries. The railroad workers who pushed and pulled the passenger could not have known that the plain brown package contained fireworks or any other dangerous materials. The case raised fundamental questions about the scope of duty of care in negligence law — specifically, whether a defendant owes a duty of care to an unforeseeable plaintiff injured by an unforeseeable chain of events set in motion by the defendant's negligent act."
